This is my first blog post on my new blog. I decided to host it on GitHubs Pages. It is more convenient since I am already working with Git.

I am also proud to announce a new Data Science project I am working on as part of my master thesis. It is about analyzing the operating reserve market in the german energy market. The aim is to enhance optimization algorithms input factors by predicting the call probability of work prices of reserve calls. For more information head over to [my latest GitHub project](https://github.com/wagnertimo/rmarketcrawlR).
