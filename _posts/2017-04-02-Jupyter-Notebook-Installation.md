[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. Notebook documents are documents produced by Jupyter Notebook which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc.). They are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc.) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.


**Step 1:** Installation of the anaconda package.

Download the newest [anaconda installer](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). You can choose between the graphical interface or the command line version for installation.


**Step 2:** Launch Jupyter Notebook.

Now you should be able to open Jupyter Notebook.
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
A session should start in your terminal and automatically open the browser with Jupyter Notebook. You can create a new file by selecting the *New* button and choosing R as the Notebook.
