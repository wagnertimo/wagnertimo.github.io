You can use the programming language `R` in Jupyter Notebook by installing the `IRkernel`.
A notebook kernel is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a notebook document. The `ipython kernel` executes python code and the `IRkernel` runs R code which will be used later. But there are also kernels for many [other languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).


Firstly, you need to install jupyter notebook with the `IRKernel`. Therefore see my post [Jupyter Notebook – Using R](../2017-04-04-Jupyter-Notebook-Using-R).
