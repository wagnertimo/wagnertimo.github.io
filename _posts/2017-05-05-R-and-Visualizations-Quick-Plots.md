In this post, I wanna talk about how you can make quick visualizations  with R. This series will be continued with advanced plotting using the neat R package `ggplot2` or interactive graphics with `plotly`. But at first let's start with some quick and dirty techniques to get a first glance at your data. As you know, every data analysis should start with summaries of exploratory statistics and most important a holistic glimpse into your data set. Let's face it, human are visual living beings.

I will briefly capture the basic graphic types:

- *[Scatter Plots](#scatter-plot)*
- *[Line Graphs](#line-graphs)*
- *[Bar Graphs](#bar-graphs)*
- *[Histograms](#histograms)*
- *[Box Plots](#box-plot)*
- *[Function Curves](#function-curves)*

### Scatter Plot

Let' start with a simple scatter plot. The sample data set we will use for the demonstrations is the build in *Motor Trend Car Road Tests* (`mtcars`) data set. Use the `str()` command to get to know the structure of the `data.frame`. As you see we have 11 numerical variables.


```R
str(mtcars)
```

    'data.frame':	32 obs. of  11 variables:
     $ mpg : num  21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ...
     $ cyl : num  6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ...
     $ disp: num  160 160 108 258 360 ...
     $ hp  : num  110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ...
     $ drat: num  3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ...
     $ wt  : num  2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ...
     $ qsec: num  16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ...
     $ vs  : num  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...
     $ am  : num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
     $ gear: num  4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ...
     $ carb: num  4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...


So let's quickly plot the weights `wt` against the gasoline consumption `mpg` (miles per gallon)

```R
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_5_0.png)


As expected, we can see a clear negative correlation. The heavier the car the less miles per gallon are driven, hence the gasoline consumption for a given distance rises.

We now use the `ggplot2` package. If you don't have it installed yet, call `install.packages("ggplot2")`.
Now we can activate the library and use its quick plot function `qplot()` to get the similiar result but in a nicer format.


```R
library(ggplot2)
qplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```




![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_7_1.png)


Looks cool right? ... And if your two variables are in the same data set you can leave out the `$` declaration and call `qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars)`

> Note that for both approaches the variables for the `x axis` is the first parameter, followed by the `y axis`

I will go more in depth with the individual plotting function `ggplot()` in later blog posts of this series. So let's move forward to line graphs.

## Line Graphs

For this demonstrations the build in `pressure` data set suits perfectly. Let's have a look...


```R
str(pressure)
```

    'data.frame':	19 obs. of  2 variables:
     $ temperature: num  0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 ...
     $ pressure   : num  0.0002 0.0012 0.006 0.03 0.09 0.27 0.75 1.85 4.2 8.8 ...


Ok... so why not check out the relationship between temperature and pressure. To declare a line graph for the base `plot()` function declare its `type` parameter with `"l"`


```R
plot(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure, type="l")
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_13_0.png)


If we want to modify the line, you can simply call e.g. `points()` in the next line with the same data to add points to the lines. When you want to display other line graphs in the same plot, just call `lines()`. To distinguish between the two lines, use the `col` parameter to define the color.


```R
plot(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure, type="l")
# add points to the line graph
points(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure)
# add another line graph with points to the current plot. Use a red color
lines(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure/2, col="blue")
points(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure/2, col="blue")
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_15_0.png)


Now let's look again at the `qplot()` function of the `ggplot2` library.


```R
qplot(temperature, pressure, data=pressure, geom="line")
```




![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_17_1.png)


Like in the case of the base `plot()` function you can simply add modification options or other lines.


```R
qplot(temperature, pressure, data=pressure, geom=c("line", "point"), color = "a") +
# Add a second line with points to the plot. Use the group parameter color for differentiation. This sets colors autom.
geom_line(aes(temperature, pressure/2, color = "b"), pressure)+
geom_point(aes(temperature, pressure/2, color = "b"), pressure) #+ scale_color_manual(values=c("black", "blue"))
```




![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_19_1.png)


To add another line to the quick plot of `ggplot2`, you have to use the plus sign `+`. This is a common procedure, also for the `ggplot()` function. You basically add other options, lines etc. to the active plot. The `aes` parameter builds the aesthetic mappings and describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of `geoms` (geometric forms: lines, points etc.). The arguments for `aes` are the `x` and `y` axis. Optionally you can set a `color` parameter for differentiation.

> Note that the `color` argument in the `qplot()` function is not equivilent to the `col` argument in the base `plot()` function. `Color` is a group parameter and sets automatically the colors. If you want to determine the used colors in the plot manually you have also to add `scale_color_manual()` to the plot function. You will see that in another post.

## Bar Graphs

To make a bar chart you can use the base function `barplot()` and pass it a vector of values for the height of each bar and (optionally) a vector of labels for each bar (`names.arg` parameter).

Let us investigate the build in data `BOD`. We have a discrete `Time` variable and continous values for the biochemical oxygen `demand`.


```R
str(BOD)
```

    'data.frame':	6 obs. of  2 variables:
     $ Time  : num  1 2 3 4 5 7
     $ demand: num  8.3 10.3 19 16 15.6 19.8


```R
# without names.arg=BOD$Time the x axis would not have labels
barplot(BOD$demand, names.arg=BOD$Time)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_23_0.png)


For every discrete Timestamp the demand value is plotted. Sometimes the `y axis` (or bars) shows the discrete counts for each category on the `x axis`. This is similar to a histogram, but with a discrete instead of continuous `x axis`. To generate the count of each unique value in a vector, call the `table()` function.


```R
table(mtcars$cyl)
# There are 11 cases with 4 cylinders, 7 cases of 6, and 14 cases of 8
```



     4  6  8
    11  7 14


Now you can easily use the `barplot()` function to generate a visualization out of that information.


```R
# Generate a table of cylinder counts
barplot(table(mtcars$cyl))
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_27_0.png)


In `ggplot2` you can use the `qplot()` function for a fast way to show a count-based bar chart. Notice the difference between a continous and a discrete `x axis`. Call the `factor()` method to discretize the `x` values.


```R
 # cyl is continuous here
qplot(mtcars$cyl)
# Treat cyl as discrete
qplot(factor(mtcars$cyl))
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_29_3.png)



![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_29_4.png)


## Histograms

Now we will view the distribution of one-dimensional data with a histogram. Let's see how the gasoline consumption of the cars in the `mtcars` data set is distributed.


```R
hist(mtcars$mpg)
# Specify approximate number of bins with breaks
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=10)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_31_0.png)



![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_31_1.png)


The chart at the bottom has more bins. Notice that because the bins are narrower, there are fewer items in each bin.

With the `ggplot2` package you can get a similar result using `qplot()`.


```R
library(ggplot2)

# default bin width
qplot(mtcars$mpg)
# with wider bins
qplot(mpg, data=mtcars, binwidth=4)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_33_3.png)



![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_33_4.png)


## Box Plots

Now it is time to focus on Box plots. It is a helpful tool to compare distributions. Therfore, let's dive into the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.


```R
str(ToothGrowth)
```

    'data.frame':	60 obs. of  3 variables:
     $ len : num  4.2 11.5 7.3 5.8 6.4 10 11.2 11.2 5.2 7 ...
     $ supp: Factor w/ 2 levels "OJ","VC": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
     $ dose: num  0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 ...


We want to compare the tooth length of the two supplement types (`VC` or `OJ`). So we can look at the box plots. The base `plot()`function will automatically create a box plot when `x` is a factor. So pass it a factor of x values and a vector of y values. Here, `supp` is a factor value with two levels `VC` and `OJ`, where `y` is the numerical length value.


```R
plot(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$len)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_37_0.png)


As we can see, the group of guinea pigs which got the orange juice (`OJ`) have a higher median and quartiles as well as the spread of lengths is narrower.

If the two vectors are in the same data frame, you can also use the *formula syntax* (a typical `R` procedure as seen in other functions). With this syntax, you can also combine two variables on the `x axis`. We can see then how the `dose` variable (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) interacts with the supplement group (`OJ` or `VC`).


```R
# Formula syntax
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)
# Put interaction of two variables on x axis
boxplot(len ~ supp + dose, data = ToothGrowth)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_39_0.png)



![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_39_1.png)


Not surprisingly, as the dose of vitamine C rises the tooth length does too. And with 2 mg/day the medians of the two supplement groups are the same. But the `VC` group has more variance. The lowest variance (except of one outlier) is achieved with 1 mg/day of ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as `VC`).

As you should already guess, slightly* the same results can be achieved with `qplot()` (* Read the note section at the end). You only have to declare the `geom` parameter as `"boxplot"`. To combine more variables, you have to use the `interaction()` function as `x` variable; formula syntax is not allowed.


```R
library(ggplot2)

qplot(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$len, geom="boxplot")
# Using three separate vectors
qplot(interaction(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$dose), ToothGrowth$len,geom="boxplot")
```

![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_41_3.png)



> You may noticed that the box plots from the base graphics are slightly different from `ggplot2`. This is because they use different methods for calculating quantiles. See `?geom_boxplot` and `?boxplot.stats` for more information.

## Function Curves

If you want to plot a function use `curve()` and pass it an expression with the variable x. Define the `from` and `to` arguments to set the domain.


```R
curve(x^3 - 5*x, from=-4, to=4)
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_44_0.png)


You can also define your own function. It just has to output a numeric vector. Using `add = TRUE` will add a curve to the previously created plot. We will show this by plotting the inverse function.


```R
# Plot a user-defined function
myfun <- function(xvar) {
    1/(1 + exp(-xvar + 10))
}

curve(myfun(x), from=0, to=20)
# Add a line:
curve(1-myfun(x), add = TRUE, col = "red")
```


![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_46_0.png)


For the `ggplot2` package equivilent, one used `qplot(c(0,2), fun=myfun, stat="function", geom="line")` But now `stat` is deprecated in 2016 and `fun` is no longer an acceptable parameter.

To get similar results with the `ggplot2` package you now have to use the `ggplot()` method and call the `stat_function()` with parameter `fun`. The domain input has to be defined as a `data.frame`


```R
library(ggplot2)

# Plot a user-defined function
myfun <- function(xvar) {
    1/(1 + exp(-xvar + 10))
}

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 20)), aes(x)) +
stat_function(fun=myfun)
```




![png](/images/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_files/R_and_Visualizations_Quick_Plots_48_1.png)


So now you should have a basic understanding to plot some quick graphs to get a first look into your data. I will try to continue this series with more detailed explanations on how to use the `ggplot2` package with the `ggplot()` function since this is more powerful for making expressive charts.
