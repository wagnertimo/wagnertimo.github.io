This is the introductionary part of a series of blog posts which will focus on data visualizations with R. It extends my first post about [quick plotting techniques in R](../2017-05/R-and-Visualizations-Quick-Plots). Now it is time to dive into the structure of `ggplot2`.

First we are going to load (or install if not done yet) the `tidyverse` package. It is a nice collection of R packages which include useful pre-defined function for the workflow of data wrangling and visualization. It e.g. contains `dplyr` or `tidyr` which allow you to work with `data.frames` in a nice and easy (natural) way (we will cover data wrangling in other blog posts). And of course we have `ggplot2` loaded.

``` r
# If not installed already: install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
    ## Loading tidyverse: tibble
    ## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
    ## Loading tidyverse: readr
    ## Loading tidyverse: purrr
    ## Loading tidyverse: dplyr

    ## Conflicts with tidy packages ----------------------------------------------

    ## filter(): dplyr, stats
    ## lag():    dplyr, stats

Data Set
--------

Now everything is setup, let's look at some data. `ggplot2` contains a data set called `mpg` which consits of observations from the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

To get a first peek into the data use the `str()` and `head()` function to see what the structure and the first observations look like. All in all we have 11 variables with numerical and character values. If you want to get more information what the variables actually mean, use the help command `?mpg`.

``` r
str(mpg)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    234 obs. of  11 variables:
    ##  $ manufacturer: chr  "audi" "audi" "audi" "audi" ...
    ##  $ model       : chr  "a4" "a4" "a4" "a4" ...
    ##  $ displ       : num  1.8 1.8 2 2 2.8 2.8 3.1 1.8 1.8 2 ...

    ##  $ class       : chr  "compact" "compact" "compact" "compact" ...

``` r
head(mpg)
```

Basic ggplot elements
---------------------

### First Plot

Now that we know what variables we have in the data set we can build our first plot. Let us investigate the relationship between the size of the car engine `displ` and the fuel efficency `hwy` (highway miles per gallon, the higher the number the more efficient).

`ggplot2` has its *base function* `ggplot()` which just returns an empty plot. The base function takes in the `data` parameter. Later every variable call is refered to that data set (no assignment like e.g. `data$column` is needed).

To enrich the plot with data, you can then literally add (with the `+` sign) other graphical elements to the plot. In our case, we will add now points (`geom_point()`) to the plot with the `displ` variable **mapped** to the **x** axis and the value of the respective `hwy` **mapped** on the **y** axis. Such mappings where you connect a variable with a visual property are *sumed up* in an aesthetic (`aes()` function). You will see later that you can also map e.g. the color of a graphical element to the value of a variable.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

This is the standard plot. Therefore `ggplot2` adjust automatically the scales and labels the axis in a nice visual format. We will see later how one can manually modify those graph properties.

You can clearly see a negative correlation. This means that, the bigger the engine the more fuel is needed. But on the far right you can notice a few points lying a bit above the trend. What could those cars be? Hybrids? To answer that question we have to look at the type or `class` of the car. So let's continue and add another visual property to our plot.

### Aesthetics

As I described earlier `ggplot2` uses **aesthetic mappings** to map the value of variables to a visual property like position of **x** and **y** axis on the grid. But you can also map to a **color** (or british english: colour), **shape** or **size** (see bottom for a list of aesthetics) which adds somehow a 3rd dimension. So let us now extend our aesthetics in the plot with `aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)`.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

Now we can see what observations belong to which type of car. So our *hybrid* cars are actually two seaters, smaller or lighter cars which need less fuel. The big SUV and Pickup cars are as suspected on the lower edge.

Again `ggplot2` chooses automatically an appropriate color scheme. Try out the two other aesthetics (shape and size) by yourself. Notice that for color and shape it makes sense to map them to a categorical variable where as size is appropriate for continuous variables. The shape aesthetic has also a maximum of 6 values. But if your data should have more than 6 levels, you must specify them manually (R has 25 built in shapes that are identified by numbers).

You can also use logical expression for an aesthetic like color. Try e.g. `aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ > 5)`. This will seperate your data in red and blue observations based on the logical expression.

List of aesthetics:
- x (required)
- y (required)
- alpha
- colour
- fill
- group
- shape
- size
- stroke

For further information about aesthetics take a look at the [cran specification](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html).

### Facets

Let us now learn more about a cool feature of `ggplot2` which suits perfectly to look at categorical variables, the **facets**. Facets are basically subplots within a plot. So for each level of a categorical variable you get a plot.

Therefore you need to add the `facet_wrap()` function to your plot and specify by a **formula** object (name of a data structure in R, not a synonym for *equation*. Formulas use the tilt sign `~`. They can also be used to build models). The formula defines on which variable the subplots are created.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class)
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

As always `ggplot2` automatically aligns the subplots. But you can also specify the number of rows or columns, e.g. `facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)`.

The use of formula expression along with `facet_grid()` allows you to combine two variables. Let us look on all subplots of combinations of drive type (`drv`) and cylinders (`cyl`)

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

### Geometric Objects

You can use different visual objects to represent data. Till now we used points as a geometrical object to create a scatterplot. In `ggplot2` such objects are called **geom**. There are different types of geoms. Here is an excerpt of the most important:

-   `geom_point()` - plot a scatterplot
-   `geom_line()` - plot a line graph
-   `geom_smooth` - plot a smooth line fitted to the data
-   `geom_bar()` - plots bars like a histogram
-   `geom_density()` - plots a density graph for continuous data
-   `geom_boxplot()` - plots a boxplot

All in all over 30 geoms are provided and extension packages provide even more (see <https://www.ggplot2-exts.org> for a sampling). Similarily, look at the [ggplot2 reference](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms) or check out the [cheatsheet](http://rstudio.com/cheatsheets) for further information.

Let's have a look how differently our scatterplot is represented as a smoothed line plot.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Here you clearly see the upspike at the end which again is due to our two seater cars.

Note that each geom in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. The shape aaesthetic makes sense for a point geom, but for a line geom. On the other hand, you can set the **linetype** of a line, not of a point.

So let us plot different line styles for each drive type (`drv` `4` = four-wheel drive, `f` = front-wheel drive and `r` = rear-wheel drive):

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

As you maybe notice, the lines do not all go from begining till end. This is due to the fact that there is not enough data for this combinations.

Another way to distinguish the line plot between the drivetrain types (`drv`) would be to use the color aesthetic again. But there is also the so called **group** aesthetic which groups the data according to the factor levels. The difference lies in the coloring scheme. There is also no legend provided with group.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)


Try out the color aesthetic yourself to see the difference


### Multiple geoms

Now it is time to enrich our plot even further and use multiple geoms. How about combining `geom_point()` with `geom_smooth`:

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

As explained earlier, the structure of `ggplot2` is to add graphical elements to your base function (empty plot: `ggplot()`). Here we simply add the two geoms to the plot. You might ask yourself, but what if i want to change the aesthetics, then i have to change them in both geom objects. You are right, and this duplication can be avoided by defining the mappings already in the base function of `ggplot()`. So we will treat these mappings as *global mappings* that apply to each geom in the graph. Hence,

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

will create the same plot. If you add now mappings into the geom objects, they will be treated as *local mappings*. They extend or overwrite the global mappings for that *layer* only.

You can go even further and define new data for a *layer* in the geom object: `geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"))`

> Note: `filter()` is a function of the `dplyr` package.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```

### Statistical charts

One of the plots which can give a nice and easy overview about the frequency of variables are bar charts. In `ggplot2` we can use `geom_bar()`. To go further into the details of the functionality we will use the `diamonds` data set contained in the `ggplot2` package. There are about 54,000 diamonds, including the price, carat, color, clarity, and cut of each diamond.

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

You can see that there are a lot more diamonds with great cut quality than with bad quality. You may notice that this time, there is now **y** aesthetic mapped to a variable. Despite, there is a **count** variable as y axis. This variable is automatically generated by `ggplot2`. New values are also calculated by other plots like e.g. histograms and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts. Or the already seen smooth geom object fit a model to your data and then plots the predictions.

The method behind that generation of new values is **stat**. This leads us to the notion of **statistical transformation**. For `geom_bar()` the default `stat` argument is *count* (see `?geom_bar`). So it uses the `stat_count()` method. Vice versa, ever stat method has also by default a geom object. Hence,

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

would generate the same bar chart. But sometimes it is nicer to see the proportions rather than the absulute counts. Therefore, we can specify the y aesthetic with `..prop..`. This overrides the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics.

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

In `ggplot2` you have over 20 stat functions (see `?stat_bin` or the [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)).

Another example would be to use `stat_summary()`. We will specify some of its parameters to mimic a boxplot with min, max and median values of the total depth of the diamonds (y axis) grouped by their cut quality (x axis).

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

Now let's bring some color into the game. We already know that we can use the color aesthetic to map a color for points or lines to a variable. This is also possible for bar geom objects. Just set the same varible of the x aesthetic to the color aesthetic, e.g. `aes(x = cut, color = cut)`. But this will give the bars a colored frame and will not fill them with colors. Try your own...

For bar charts it is better to use **fill** aesthetic. So it is even possible to visualize more variables. Let us look at the different distribution of the `clarity`(*I1* = worst, ..., IF = best) meassures within each cut quality:

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

We see that the best quality diamonds, also have the most clear diamonds. Such bar charts are called **stacked bar charts**. This leads us again to another notion of **position adjustment** which is specified by the **position** argument in the `bar_geom()` (like the stat argument). By default the position parameter is set to `"stack"`. Hence,

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "stack")
```

would produce the same stacked bar chart. But there are also other position adjustments like e.g. `position = "fill"` or `position = "dodge"`. Try them out yourself.

``` r
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

### Coordinate functions

Almost done... Now we will cover coordinate functions to complement the structural template of building plots with `ggplot2`. By default the Cartesian coordinate system is used. The x and y positions determine the location of the points on the plot. There are several other coordinate systems that helpful for different use cases.

With `coord_flip()` you are able to change the x and y axis. This can be useful if the labels on the x axis of your original plot are too big. Look at this boxplot. If the axis where flipped the labels would be impossible to read.

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

![](/images/R_and_Visualizations_ggplot_basics_files/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

### Template and Structure of ggplot

Below in the code snippet you can see the general template for building plots in `ggplot2`. The values in brackets (`<...>`) are variables which the user has to define. Not all are needed to be specified, `ggplot2` provides useful default values; except for the data, geoms, and mappings.

``` r
ggplot(data = <DATA>) +
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>,
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

If you follow this formal system, you can describe any plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme.

I hope the examples could give you a basic understanding about the structure of `ggplot2`. In further blog posts we will go more in depth on how to custumize plots and we will look at specific plot types.
