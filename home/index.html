  Hi! My name is Timo. I am currently a master student at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology (KIT). I am passionated about Data Science. I like to crawl the web for data and I am also keen on machine learning algorithms.
  Currently I am working on predicting call probabilities for operating reserve work prices on the german reserve market. When not diving into data, I also love sailing, running, skiing, cooking and music.
