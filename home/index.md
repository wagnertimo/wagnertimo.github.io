Hi! My name is Timo. I am currently a master student at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology (KIT). I am passionated about Data Science. I like to crawl the web for data and I am also keen on machine learning algorithms.
With this blog I want to try to document my journey about learning the insights around Data Science. I also want to help others for a better understanding of machine learning algorithms and the practical use of those tools. If you want to know more or want to share a project, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
